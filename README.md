SUGGESTION BOX PROJECT
***********************************************************************************************************************
Project Aim:
The Suggestion Box mainly targets companies and employees who post suggestions for their internal users to react to them. It works
well in a local area network where guys can like what their colleagues upload, dislike and also flag some of the
suggestions as offensive. Moreover, once a suggestion is termed offensive by at least 3 guys, then the suggestion should be
automatically removed.

Getting Started:
A user is required to have an account to use the features of this system. So, it all begins by Signing up:
 1. User Registers using the email address issued to him/her by the company
 2. After the user account, you are required to login to the system
 3. You are then directed to a Dashboard that presents the suggestions posted by your colleagues.
 4. You can choose to post a suggestion via a form that is presented at the Dashboard Area.
 5. Also, you can choose not to comment but look at your colleagues suggestions and react to them.
 6. React by commenting, liking, disliking or even flagging the suggestions as offensive.
 7. Once a suggestion is viewed as offensive by various people, the system is obliged to delete that from the display of other users.
 8. Lastly, after reacting to suggestions, the user can easily log out of the system.
